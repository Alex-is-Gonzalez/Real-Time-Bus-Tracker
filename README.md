## Description
Currently track real time buses using data from MBTA with this code. The page updates the buses' location every 15 seconds. The red and blue bus icons represent opposite directions of travel.  
## Installation 
Download a copy of the Real-Time-Bus-Tracker repo. Drag and drop "mapanimation.html" onto a blank webpage and load the page. You should see a map with blue and red bus icons. Wait 15 seconds to see the buses' location update in real time.

## Usage
This repo demostrates the ability to use public APIs and asynchronous code.

## Roadmap
This project has the potential to transform tremendoulsy due to the integration of JSON data. One feature that will be added in the future, is allowing the user to press on the bus icon, displaying the avialable seats on the bus. From there, other bus routes along with their corresponding icon color will be added.
